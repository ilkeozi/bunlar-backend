This repository contains the **backend** for the **Bunlar** project, a platform for structured, constructive online debates. The backend is built using **NestJS** and deployed on **AWS Lambda** using the **Serverless Framework**.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (version 16.x.x or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) (comes with Node.js)
- [Serverless Framework](https://www.serverless.com/) (Globally installed):

  `npm install -g serverless`

## Installation

1.  Clone the repository:

        `git clone https://github.com/ilkeozi/bunlar-backend.git`
        `cd bunlar-backend`

2.  Install the dependencies:

    `npm install`

## Running the Project Locally

### 1. Compile the NestJS Project

Before running the project, compile the TypeScript code into JavaScript:

`npm run build`

### 2. Set Up Environment Variables

Youâ€™ll need to set up your environment variables by creating a `.env` file in the root directory. Example:

`MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/bunlar-dev
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key`

### 3. Run the Project with Serverless Offline

You can emulate the AWS Lambda environment locally using the **serverless-offline** plugin. To run the project locally:

`npm run offline`

The API will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### 4. Running in Development Mode with Hot-Reloading

Alternatively, you can run the NestJS server in development mode with hot-reloading:

`npm run start:dev`

This will run the backend without the AWS Lambda simulation but with hot-reloading enabled for rapid development.

## Scripts

Here are some of the key scripts available in the project:

- **Build**: Compile the project:

  `npm run build`

- **Start Development**: Run the NestJS project in development mode:

  `npm run start:dev`

- **Run Offline**: Simulate the Lambda environment locally:

  `npm run offline`

- **Lint**: Run the linter:

  `npm run lint`

- **Test**: Run unit tests:
  `npm run test`

## Testing

The project uses **Jest** for testing. To run the tests:

`npm run test`

For watching tests during development:

`npm run test:watch`

## Deployment

This project uses the **Serverless Framework** to deploy to AWS Lambda. To deploy the project, run:

`sls deploy`

Make sure you have AWS credentials configured in your environment.
